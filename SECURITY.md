## Security Considerations

This project uses several external dependencies. It is important to keep these dependencies up to date to ensure security.

The project also integrates with external AI services (OpenRouter, Ollama, etc.) which may have their own security considerations.

## Best Practices

When using this project, we recommend:

1. Using environment variables for API keys and sensitive configuration
2. Keeping dependencies up to date
3. Using a virtual environment to isolate dependencies
4. Regularly reviewing and updating security configurations
5. Following the principle of least privilege when configuring services
